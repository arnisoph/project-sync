      This formula might uses the formhelper module which is a very useful Salt execution module that isn't available in upstream yet. Please consider retrieving it manually from https://github.com/bechtoldt/salt-modules and make it available to your Salt installation. Read `SaltStack documentation <http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/modules/#modules-are-easy-to-write>`_ to see how this can be achieved.

      Take a look at older releases (branches) to get a version that isn't using the formhelper yet (if any).
